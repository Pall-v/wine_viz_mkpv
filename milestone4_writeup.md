# Milestone 4 Write Up

For milestone 4, given the time limit that we had, we implemented further formatting and design updates/upgrades, wrote in code comments to better our applications documentation, and incorporating a swarm plot with an efficient frontier line into our plot (and switching out our previous scatterplot). We believed these were the best changes to implement as we could do all of the changes efficiently and quickly, without getting to stuck in the details about making dramatic changes to our plot. The changes we made, aside from better documentation, was updating sidebar colours to match the overall theme of our app, updating axis lines, and getting rid of plot grid lines that took away from the whitespace needed for our app. 

If we were to recreate our app again, the initial wrangling from the app would most likely be done much more efficiently and done first, instead of doing as we go. This made us go back and forth with the many different formats of data frames, which wasted some time. Another thing we could do differently is to have a much stronger understanding of plotly before creating an app containing only plotly charts. Doing more research and practicing on plotly would definitely have sped up our app creation and perfecting timelines. Other than those two, we are both very pleased with how our application turned out and would likely create the similar three plots again. 

The greatest challenges we faced for the final product was our frontier line....


The final changes made from Milestone 3 to Milestone 4 can be seen below:

Briefly discuss:

What changes did you decide to implement given the time limit, and why do you think this is the best thing to focus on?
If you were to make the app again from scratch (or some other app in general), what would you do differently?
What were the greatest challenges you faced in creating the final product?

Here, we'll be grading your reasoning for the changes. Don't worry about "optimizing" your decision, we're just looking for sensibility here.
