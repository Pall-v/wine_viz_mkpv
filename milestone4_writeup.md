# Milestone 4 Write Up

Briefly discuss:

What changes did you decide to implement given the time limit, and why do you think this is the best thing to focus on?
If you were to make the app again from scratch (or some other app in general), what would you do differently?
What were the greatest challenges you faced in creating the final product?

Here, we'll be grading your reasoning for the changes. Don't worry about "optimizing" your decision, we're just looking for sensibility here.
