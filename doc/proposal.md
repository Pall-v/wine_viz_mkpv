# Overview
There are a vast number of wines to choose from in the world.  The number of available options is far too big to be considered and tasted individually by anyone.  Therefore, to make informed buying decisions, you need some information about all of the options and a way to efficiently use this information.

We propose a data visualization application which will allow buyers to explore the data to identify the best value wines that have the features they desire.  The app will allow users to filter wines according to the features they are interested in and select to select individual wines according to their price and rating.  It will also let them to see the distribution of ratings across the other features that they filtered by.

# Usage scenario & tasks / question to explore
As a wine buyer for a restaurant group, I want to reduce the many available wines to a shortlist that match certain criteria so that I have a manageable number of them to consider tasting for inclusion on the wine list. It is important that I can narrow my results by the features that I balance the wine list across.  The ideal wines for shortlisting have at least an above average price-rating ratio to help identify wines that provide the best value.  

When I log into the "Wine Buyer" app, I see a map of the world and a list of variables in the dataset.  I filter the data by the variables representing the features of the wines that I will need to balance out the wine list.  I then choose the final shortlist based on the price-rating ratio combined with *#TBD (my expert knowledge of those wines/the review)?*

 *#TBD: did not draft the walkthrough to go with this next part of the scenario yet since it might put us over our word count. We can just scrap this part if it's not needed:*
I would also like to identify which countries or regions have the highest-rated wines in the varieties that are most popular with our customers.  I need to foster strategic relationships with the suppliers of those regions, and I will feature curated selections from them so that we can buy from them in higher volumes to get better price discounts.
