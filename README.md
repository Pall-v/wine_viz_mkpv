# Explore Wine Shiny Visualization App

Created by: Miliban Keyim and Paul Vial

## Overview

There are a vast number of wines from different wineries to choose from in the world. The number of available options is far too large to be considered and tasted individually by anyone. Therefore, to make informed buying decisions we have sommeliers and tasters give us ratings about different wines. However even then, we are bombarded with a very large number of different wines, all with great ratings. This leads us to believe that we need some information about all of the options and a way to efficiently use what we know about the wine, to make the best purchase.

We propose a data visualization application which will allow buyers to explore the wine data to identify the best valued wines that have the features they desire. This visualization will allow the user to see the distribution of ratings across other wine data fields and see how each attribute affects or relates to the rating. The application will allow users to explore and filter wines according to the characteristics they are interested in and to select individual wines by to their price and rating for further inquiry.
