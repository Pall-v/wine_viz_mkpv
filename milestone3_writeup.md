# Milestone 3 Write-up

In milestone 3, we received feedback from two other groups and our TA on how we can further improve our app. The following are the changes that were made. 


### Reflection on feedback:

The usability of our app at milestone 2 was that it had a few functionality problems to fix. This made for a fairly straightforward peer review in that our peers could quickly point out how we can improve the functionality of our filters, which was a great help. 
Other feedback included small detail changes that can help the user better navigate our app (like minor labelling or hover-tooltip changes) that improved the overall user experience by helping them understand the app more quickly.
Given the timeframe that we had to improve the app, most but not all changes were able to be made. Almost all of the functionality of the app that included filters was implemented, along with small design tweaks and plot changes that made for a better-looking and more comprehensible app. 
What could not be implemented given the time constraint was to make our world map and our variety bar chart interact-able (clickable) and to act as a filter. This can perhaps be moved to milestone 4.
The feedback given about the specific filters and the over-plotting of our scatterplot was the most valuable in that it shows that the user can be confused or overwhelmed by the data if they are looking at it for the first time, unlike us who have familiarity with what we built. This was very helpful and resulted in us constructing a price category that reduces the over-plotting and switching the scatter to a swarm plot. 

The fly-on-the-wall experience is always helpful because the creator of the app is able to see what the initial reaction is with fresh eyes. Building an app with a specific set of data will create bias for the builder in the sense that we might assume users just know about specific features, but that is definitely not the case. Understanding what users initial thoughts are can automatically help us understand how we can improve the app and create a better user experience. 
Our feedback session definitely helped us improve our app to be more functional and communicate better as a tool for wine explorers. 

### Changes since milestone 2:

A lot of positive changes have been made to our app since milestone 2. The overall app is completely functional (aside from the selectable map) and is easily navigable with instructions and intuitive error messages. It has an overall better and sleek design with more concise labels and little to no redundancy. 
Our objective of making an exploratory app on the world's top-rated wines has stayed the same.
